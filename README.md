### N Mark (Grade) Non-Attendant Policy 
This mark is awarded to students who, though registered, never attended class, did not officially drop, and (if an online or hybrid class) have no gradable work. Marks of "N" do not satisfy prerequisites and are non-transferable. This mark is not used in the calculation of GPA, but it may affect eligibility for financial aid. Instructors confirm non-attendance by the "N" Mark Report Date (found in MyOCC for each section) and then submit their "N" marks to the institution. Students who have received an "N" mark will not be permitted to enter the class, nor will the student be able to drop the class. After the "N" mark has been submitted, a change of grade will not be accepted for the student. For more information refer to OCC's Grading Policy.
